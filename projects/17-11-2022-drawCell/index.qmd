This was originally a proof of concept, check out the [Linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6833816928826482689/){target="_blank"}.
It was later improved with the help of a colleague, (_thanks Recle!_). 
You can learn more about it in the [blog post](https://appsilon.com/drawcell-app-for-drawing-cells/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=){target="_blank"} that we created at Appsilon.
