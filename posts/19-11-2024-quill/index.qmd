I worked once on a legacy code base where there hundreds (or more!) of lines to implement a text editor.
This code was an R shiny web application, and I noticed that this tool, a library that quickly loads
a text editor didn't exist in the R world.

So, I decided to build one myself. 

## Example

```{r}
library(quill)
quill(toolbar_options(image = FALSE, video = FALSE))
```

## Why Quill?
The idea for Quill came out of necessity. There wasn’t a simple tool in R that allowed developers to embed a rich text editor into their apps. Sure, there are solutions for forms, plots, and dashboards, but nothing specifically for polished text editing.

That’s when I discovered [QuillJS](https://quilljs.com/), a lightweight JavaScript library for building text editors. It was exactly what I was looking for: clean, customizable, and perfect for embedding. But there was a problem—it wasn’t accessible from R. I’d have to bridge the gap. With the use of the
R package `htmlwidgets` this was possible.

## How to use quill?

Like any other htmlwidget, there is an UI function: `quillOutput()`, and a server function: `renderQuill()`. You can select the options of the toolbar with `toolbar_options`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## basic example of functioning in Shiny
library(quill)

ui <- fluidPage(
  ... 
  quillOutput("text_editor")
  ...
)

server <- function(input, output, ...) {
  ...
  output$text_editor <- renderQuill({
    quill(toolbar = toolbar_options(code = TRUE)) 
  })

  # You can listen what the user is writing in HTML, JSON, and plain text
  observeEvent(input$text_editor_content, {
    get_editor_content(input$text_editor_content, format = "HTML")
  }
  ...
}
```

You can see an example Shiny app [here](https://github.com/svalvaro/quill/blob/main/inst/examples/shiny/app.R).

## What Quill Can Do
The Quill package makes it easy to:

- Add a modern text editor to Shiny apps or R Markdown documents.
- Customize the toolbar to include options like bold, italics, headers, or links.
- Retrieve and process user input in real-time.
Lessons Learned

If you’ve ever thought, “Why isn’t there a package for this?” you’re not alone. The beauty of open-source is that if something doesn’t exist, you can build it. That’s what I did with Quill, and I hope it inspires others to do the same.
