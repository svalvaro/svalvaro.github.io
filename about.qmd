## {{< fa code title="Code symbol">}} Profession

Currently, I am working as an R developer at [Appsilon](https://appsilon.com){target="_blank"}. I am focused on creating web applications focused on data analysis and data visualization for pharmaceutical companies, such as Merck, J&J or Genmab. Usually, the typical _tools_ that I use for these are R, CSS, HTML, SQL and Javascript. This is a job I love doing; it combines my interests in life sciences and programming.

I am a curious person by heart; I need to understand the _how_ and _why_ of things. That’s why after my bachelor's in Biotechnology, I decided to study a master's in _Genetics and Evolution_. This fascinating world led me to move to Prague, Czech Republic. There, I studied the genetics of Mice and their metabolism for a couple of years. I slowly became a self-taught programmer and I started to work as a bioinformatician in the proteomics field I discovered
[R Shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/){target="_blank"} and quickly started to create apps for my former lab, later Appsilon discovered me, reaching the present.

I love learning by creating proof of concepts (it's fun!).  I’ll never forget when I was tinkering around with APIs, I created an R package that went kinda viral on
